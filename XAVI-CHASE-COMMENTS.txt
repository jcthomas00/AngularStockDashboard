Hi there!

1. Visually display the live data changes instead of having it with the candlestick chart

2. Put the links in an actual link tag. I'm trying to copy the text and it's not letting me

2.a The drag and drop columns are pretty dope, though!

3. It isn't displaying different historical data if you select a different ticker/stock

4. Make sure to also make it so that a user can select a range of dates to view. 
Having the entire year display makes it difficult to view, and using plotly's zoom function is absolute garbanzo beans

5. YO HOW DID YOU GET PIPE TAP WORKING???
